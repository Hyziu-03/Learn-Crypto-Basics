            <p class="paragraph">It is a public platform that uses blockchain
                technology to facilitate smart contracts and cryptocurrency trading securely without a third party. The
                Ethereum blockchain also supports decentralised digital currency - known as
                Ether - but with the added innovation of something called Smart
                Contracts.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Smart Contracts are automated, enforceable agreements
                that don’t need third-party intermediaries. They are essentially programmable agreements, executed
                without any human involvement.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Applications built on Ethereum are decentralised and
                can be created and used without permission or regulation from any centralised third party. They are
                called DApps - decentralised applications.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Hence, Ethereum as the World
                Computer. It is the world’s first programmable blockchain. In this sense, Ethereum
                provides a platform that allows applications to run without any possibility of downtime, fraud or
                third-party interference, powered by network of computers participating based on economic incentive.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">The Origin Of Ethereum</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Ethereum was first proposed in a 2013 white paper by
                Vitalik Buterin. Vitalik was a programmer who wanted to build on top of
                Bitcoin’s innovation and bring application development capability to the blockchain world.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Vitalik’s vision for the blockchain space was that
                instead of having individual blockchains for individual applications, there would be one
                blockchain
                platform that anyone could build decentralised applications on top of.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">To provide a platform that allows developers to build
                applications, and users to use applications that are decentralised - there is no central third
                party
                control; reliably secure - fraud and third party interference are very difficult if not
                impossible;
                universally accessible - anyone can build, deploy and use Ethereum applications without the need
                for
                permission.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">Ethereum's Unique
                Characteristics</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Ethereum was designed as a blockchain with a built-in
                Turing complete programming language - called Solidity
                - that can be used to create smart contracts. All that Turing complete means is that
                Solidity is a programming language capable of programming for any hypothetical computation.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Thus, in theory, any computer application can be
                programmed in Solidity and run on the Ethereum platform. This language, therefore, is what Ethereum’s
                ‘smart contracts’ are written in. Unlike Bitcoin, however, Ethereum also allows for other currencies to
                be used on the platform. Anyone can create assets and use Ethereum to trade them. These are known as
                tokens.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Some famous applications of tokens include
                stablecoins: tokens tied to a traditional currency’s value, solving much of the volatility
                problem with current cryptocurrencies; governance tokens - these can represent
                voting power for a decentralised app; collectables tokens - these tokens can
                represent collectable items such as digital art or collectable game items. These are commonly known as
                NFTs.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">Ethereum Ecosystem</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">More recently, Ethereum has powered the explosion of
                the decentralised finance industry, otherwise known as DeFi.
                Innovations include decentralised exchanges and lending platforms amongst many others.
                The industry is young, moves fast and is continually growing and is an excellent example of the power of
                Ethereum.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Another interesting example of the power and perhaps
                the dangers of the Ethereum platform is the DAO. The DAO was a digital
                Decentralised Autonomous Organisation and a form of investor-directed venture
                capital fund.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">Ethereum's Limitations</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">When Ethereum launched, it was seen as an upgraded
                version of Bitcoin not just because it made DApps possible, but also because it upgraded the number of
                transactions that could be processed per second.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This lent more scalability to the platform, but it’s
                still constrained. Bitcoin can handle around 5 transactions per second, whereas Ethereum can handle
                about 30. Compare this with a platform like VISA that can run 50,000 per second, and we can see the
                current limitations of cryptocurrencies.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This limitation of Ethereum, coupled with its ability
                to empower developers to produce DApps, led to the rise of the ICO ecosystem.
                An ICO - initial coin offering - initially funded Ethereum; inspiring many
                developers to raise funds similarly.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Many promised things that they couldn’t deliver on the
                current Ethereum platform. Thus, the resulting ICO frenzy where teams raised lots of money but often
                failed to deliver on their promises.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">ETH 2.0 And Proof Of Stake</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Sharding is a computer science technique used to
                distribute the load on a particular network. In Ethereum’s case, the idea is to spread the transactional
                and contractional data processing load across 64 different chains. It is hoped that this technique will
                improve Ethereum’s capacity to process transactions to up to 100,000 per second.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Proof-of-stake is an
                alternative way for blockchains to achieve consensus. These are known as consensus
                mechanisms. Up until now, Bitcoin and Ethereum have used a mechanism known as
                proof-of-work.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Proof-of-work is very costly
                in terms of computer processing power which translates to high energy costs. It also risks the network
                being corrupted if mining centres grouped together and took control of more than 50% of the network.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Proof-of-stake aims to address these two problems by
                randomising the consensus burden rather than having it as a competition. Switching to proof of stake
                will see a transition from miners to validators. There will still be a reward
                for confirming transactions; however, it will be more of a random selection than proof-of-work.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As we saw earlier Ethereum’s transaction
                fees are known as Gas and naturally, these fees
                fluctuate with demand and are limited by Ethereum’s transaction processing limitations. Increased demand
                and a limited supply are a recipe for high fees.</p>
