            <p class="paragraph">Bitcoin participants may have sometimes conflicting
                interests, but they all share the same ultimate goal - that Bitcoin succeeds. And the more parties are
                invested in Bitcoin, the more everyone has to lose if it “breaks” - this creates a symbiotic
                relationship, one where all parties benefit.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">Design Of Bitcoin</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network of computers all
                following a set of rules and instructions for validating transactions and issuing new coins. Any
                computer running any software that respects these rules can participate in the Bitcoin network. These
                are called Bitcoin Nodes.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Bitcoin has a ledger of all the transactions, called
                the Blockchain. Transactions are recorded in blocks, which are created at set
                intervals and connect to the previous block to create a chain. There is the mechanism for adding blocks
                to the Blockchain and reaching agreement that the transactions are valid, and the whole chain accurate.
                This is called Mining.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">Blockchain</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Instead of a single ledger kept locked away by a
                central authority, Bitcoin ensures anyone can have a copy of the ledger containing all transactions that
                ever happened. Everyone can mathematically verify that every transaction in it is legitimate.
                Transactions that don’t respect the rules are automatically rejected by the software.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Bitcoin transactions are batched approximately every
                10 minutes into a block, which is then added to a long chain of blocks containing all previous
                transactions (hence the term blockchain). This process of adding the new blocks into this shared ledger
                is called mining.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">How Bitcoin Mining Works?</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Mining involves a competition for solving a complex
                mathematical problem, which takes on average 10 minutes and is adjusted every two weeks to account for
                current computing power. The winner gets to add the current block of transactions and receives a reward
                for their efforts.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The catch is, everyone can easily verify that the
                solution is right. If a miner cheats, all other participants will simply discard the block. A cheater
                would lose not just the reward, but also all the money spent in energy to mine that block. This combined
                loss far outweighs any expected profits.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Although in theory anyone can participate in mining,
                the mathematical problem is so hard, and the competition so fierce that you’d need hundreds of
                specialised computers to even stand a chance today - which is quite an investment.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">Money Supply And Inflation</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Mining is also the way by which new bitcoin are
                released into the system. Transaction fees are the sum of fees paid for all
                transactions included in that block, which vary according to demand. These are bitcoin already in
                circulation.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The current reward is set at 6.25 bitcoin per block
                until 2024. This process will continue until all 21 million BTC are out there, at which point miners
                will only receive transaction fees.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">There’s no way that anyone can arbitrarily create new
                bitcoin or mess with the issuance rate unless everyone of the network agrees to change the protocol.
                Bitcoin
                satisfies the properties of sound money with
                no one in charge.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">It is durable. The architecture of the
                blockchain makes it incredibly robust. Since every node has a copy of the ledger, destroying the
                Bitcoin network would require that all 50,000 distributed around the world would need to be
                destroyed at the same time, along with however many backups there are. That’s very unlikely.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">It is divisible. Bitcoin’s smallest unit,
                called a Satoshi, is 1/100,000,000 of one coin. In today’s values, that’s
                orders of magnitude more precise than even the smallest microtransactions would require. However,
                due to network fees, that level of precision isn’t currently practical - we’ll discuss this below.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">It is fungible. All bitcoin are created equal
                and have equal value - just like one gram of gold is equal to any other gram of gold.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">It is portable. Bitcoin is entirely digital
                and incredibly portable. It can be stored on a computer, mobile phone, and on paper. It can be
                instantly transferred anywhere in the world with just an internet connection - and even without one.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">Limitations Of Bitcoin</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">The main limitation is the trilemma between security,
                scalability, and decentralisation. This means that there are trade-offs when designing a network, and
                you can’t have all three. Fiat money, for example, is very scalable and reasonably secure. On the flip
                side, it’s completely centralised, and controlled by very few people.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Bitcoin, on the other hand, is designed to focus on
                decentralisation and it’s incredibly secure. This comes at the price of scalability. Currently,
                Bitcoin’s maximum speed hovers at around 5 transactions per second (a fraction
                of Visa’s purported 50,000+).</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This makes Bitcoin impractical for use at scale and
                explains why right now it is popular as a Store of Value and less so as a
                Medium of Exchange.</p>
