                <p class="paragraph"> A scarce commodity is something that has a limited supply. It isn’t easy to
                    create, copy, or otherwise access. That is why digital money, as cryptocurrency, isn’t a file you
                    keep on your hard drive. That would be impractical as anyone with a computer would then be able to
                    just infinitely copy it around.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">Instead, all forms of digital currency - both fiat and crypto - rely on an
                    accounting system based on digital ledgers. A ledger being an organised record of debits and credits
                    against account holders, providing a running balance.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">The Problem Of Trust In Digital Money</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">We must trust that the public institutions will behave
                    in everyone’s best interest, and by doing so we grant them the authority and control over the money
                    system. Even if this centralised system works most of the time, it still has a few noticeable
                    weaknesses. For example, while your money is legally yours, it’s never really under your custody.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">A single central point of failure is more vulnerable
                    to corruption, manipulation, or plain old external pressure. This leaves the door open to abuse,
                    mismanagement, and economic exclusion. However, sticking to our central theme, the most worrying
                    side
                    effect of fiat money - money based only on institutional trust - is how it undermines scarcity.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">Growing Money Supply</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">As more value is created via economic activity, new
                    money must be introduced in the system so that the economy can continue to flow.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">Grossly oversimplifying, new fiat money is created by
                    Commercial Banks. The extent to which they create new money is rationed by the Central Bank. These
                    are
                    common ways: Providing credit, like loans to a new customer that become deposits,
                    buying existing assets which again become deposits,
                    providing overdraft facilities, which are deposits that can be spent.</p>
