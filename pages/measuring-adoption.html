            <p class="paragraph">Bitcoin’s health metrics can be broken down to three
                key criteria, each with a number of metrics that can be used to measure them. Achieving
                Scarcity - Measuring integrity of the Monetary Supply. Security
                - A measure of how Secure the network is. Usage - Measuring
                how many people are actually using Bitcoin?</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">Is Bitcoin Achieving Scarcity?</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Bitcoin’s protocol - its rules - state that there will
                only ever be 21 million bitcoin in existence - this is the commitment to
                scarcity. So how do we measure that? The Bitcoin network is open source, enabling services to look at
                the number of Bitcoin mined and know exactly what the circulating supply is.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Based on the predictable growth in supply seen, we can
                predict the maximum supply of 21 million bitcoin will be reached in the year
                2140. You will often see a chart of the total supply of bitcoin shown in
                conjunction with a measure of inflation - showing the rate that the supply is
                growing each year.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Inflation is a measure we
                should all be familiar with, telling us how much the price of goods, for example, are going up each
                year.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">Measuring Bitcoin Issuance</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">If the issuance works as planned then maximum total
                supply will be reached as expected and Bitcoin can be expected to achieve digital scarcity. At that
                point, miners will only receive rewards from transaction fees, as there will be no new blocks to mine.
                There are however, other factors you should consider in assessing scarcity.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">Lost Coins</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">How many coins are lost and therefore unspendable?
                This is impossible to know with certainty, but estimates put the figure at around 20% of supply. This
                means the true measure of Bitcoin scarcity i.e spendable coins, is probably
                only 80% of those known to have been mined.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">Satoshi’s Coins</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">You might also argue that the 1,000,000 bitcoin
                estimated to have been mined by Satoshi are unspendable, and should be discounted from supply measures.
                This however, is subject; just because those coins haven’t moved, doesn’t they may not in the future.

            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">Fungibility</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">There have already been instances where certain
                Bitcoin addresses have been blacklisted. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office
                of Foreign Asset Control ,has listed specific addresses connected to criminal indictments which
                essentially cordon-off these from use. They are tied to hacking or scams from North Korea, Iran and
                China, but could be a sign of things to come. Should this approach broaden, those addresses and any
                funds held could only be spent at great risk.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">Hashrate</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">There is no point in a scarce money that isn’t secure.
                The role Miners play is not only to ‘issue’ new bitcoin, they also secure the network and that security
                can also be measured in an objective way, which is crucial - it is known as Hash Rate.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Hash Rate is the estimated
                computing power committed to mining over a 24hr period. Given that Bitcoin works on incentive, the
                energy a miner expends must be less than or equal to the reward for the work/energy contributed -
                converted at fiat market rate - or they wouldn’t participate.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The higher Hash Rate goes, the harder Bitcoin is to
                corrupt and therefore, the more secure it is. It seems the hashrate increases over time.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">Measuring Usage</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Number of blockchain
                adresses is the raw measure of the number of unique reference points on the
                Bitcoin blockchain that funds can be sent to and from. It shouldn’t be confused with actual users as
                addresses can be created at no cost, and one user can have multiple addresses.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Number of transactions per
                day is more meaningful as it measures actually activity, though doesn’t specify
                what that activity relates to. Average daily transaction value is important.
                If the average value of transactions increases, this suggests greater confidence in the network.</p>
