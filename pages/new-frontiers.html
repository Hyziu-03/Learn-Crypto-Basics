            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">The Spatial Web</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">The wider advancements in digital technology and
                communication, combined with the nature of blockchain technology, mean the space tends to move
                incredibly fast. So fast that it can be very hard to keep up.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Developments in Artificial Intelligence, Augmented and
                Virtual Reality, Internet of Things (think smart cars, robotics and biometrics), as well as 5G networks,
                3d Printing and GPT-3 are all beginning to converge along with the blockchain space. These developments
                have been dubbed web 3.0 but are also known as The Spatial Web.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">To get any real sense of where the blockchain industry
                is heading, we can’t just analyse it in isolation. We must also assess how it will interact with other
                technologies and what innovations these interactions might lead to.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0"> Decentralised
                Finance</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">DeFi is an umbrella term for
                various financial applications using the programmable aspects of cryptocurrency - via smart contracts -
                to innovate wealth management.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The key innovation here is that financial instruments
                built on blockchains do not rely on intermediaries such as banks, brokerages or exchanges. This has many
                advantages.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Providing new access to finance for the unbanked population estimated
                to be over 1 billion people. Generating access to a new forms of yield.
                Enabling innovations such as decentralised stablecoins and synthetic
                tokens. Removing the barriers to entry for early stage investment.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The main criticism of DeFi is that blockchain
                transactions are irreversible and so incorrect transactions cannot always be easily reversed. Regulation
                is also tricky to the decentralisation and private nature of the industry.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">One key area of regulation is CBDCs.
                Central Bank Digital Currencies are currently heavily researched by 80% of the
                world’s central banks, and the people’s Bank of China is currently trialling their digital Yuan. CBDCs
                aren't necessarily a direct challenge to DeFi but governments playing catch-up to the innovation
                that DEFI is unleashing.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">They are hybrids that cherry-pick the elements of
                crypto that governments find useful - traceability and money supply control - while ditching those that
                challenge its role - permissionless and borderless.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">Decentralised Autonomous
                Organisations</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Decentralised Autonomous Organisations
                or DAOs are organisations powered by smart contracts represented by the organisation
                members’ rules and not influenced by central governance.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">DAO’s are challenging long-held beliefs around company
                organisation and democracy. They remove the need for mutable acceptable, trusted third parties to enable
                transactions. This makes transactions more straightforward and more efficient, but leaves the problems
                of human motivation.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">Non-Fungible-Tokens</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Non-Fungible-Tokens or NFTs
                are a specific type of cryptographic token based on blockchain technology. In contrast to Bitcoin or
                other cryptocurrencies that are fungible - can be freely exchange for other tokens - NFTs represent
                something unique and are thus not mutually interchangeable.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">NFTs are used to provide digital scarcity and power
                applications that facilitate the digital trade of art, collectables and other digital items. NFTs can
                represent in-game assets controlled by the user and can be traded on third-party marketplaces.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">Web 3.0 And Blockchain’s
                Interconnected Future</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Web 3.0, aka The Spatial Web is a set of developments
                across different technologies becoming increasingly interconnected. Blockchain technology is one
                development; also included are Artificial Intelligence, Augmented and Virtual Reality, Internet of
                Things, 5G networks, 3d Printing and many more.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Distributed Ledger
                Technology provides the power for this interconnected infrastructure. Blockchain’s
                offer a way to securely, reliably store data in a decentralised fashion. Blockchains offer a path to a
                virtually unhackable, globally shared ledger of records, events and transactions.</p>
