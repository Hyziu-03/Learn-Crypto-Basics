            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">Layer 2 And The Lightning Network</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">The Bitcoin trilemma
                highlights the difficulty of accommodating the three ideal aspects of a blockchain-based money system,
                that is security, scalability and decentralisation. Bitcoin can provide security and decentralisation
                but at the cost of scalability.</p>
            <p class="paragrph">The bitcoin blockchain can currently only process
                around five transactions per second, when Visa processes thousands of transactions per second. The term
                Layer 2 simply refers to the idea of building functionality on top of
                Bitcoin’s blockchain, to solve the scalability part of the trilemma.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The Lighting Network is a
                specific Layer 2 solution, focused on speeding up payments and competing with the likes of Visa.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The idea of Layer 2 is to build protocols or secondary
                infrastructure that can interact with a fundamental base blockchain but not be restricted by its scale
                limitations. This is where we make a clear distinction between on-chain and
                off-chain.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Transactions described as being on-chain are processed
                entirely through the relevant blockchain's consensus mechanism and recorded publicly onto the
                chain.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">Channels And Invoices</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">The technology uses micropayment
                channels to scale the bitcoin blockchain’s capability by processing
                transactions more efficiently. Micropayment channels are opened between two parties looking to
                conduct a
                transaction.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This channel is opened off-chain and without the
                overhead of the consensus mechanism, can process transactions much more efficiently than those
                that
                occur on-chain. Transactions are added to the chain once both parties have closed the channel,
                i.e.
                agreed to the transaction's validity.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">On the Lightning Network, payment channels are opened
                between two parties through multi-signature addresses. These act as mutual
                vaults that both parties can deposit funds into; multi-signature means that more than one
                signature is
                needed to release funds, a fail-safe ensuring one side cannot walk away with the funds within
                the
                channel.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">When funds are deposited, a channel is opened,
                creating a balance sheet between the two parties; this is then added to the main chain.
                Transactions
                between the two parties are recorded by updating this balance sheet to include the new balance
                between
                the two parties. These updates come in the form of Invoices.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The Lightning Network structure is designed to connect
                individual users through micropayment channels in the most efficient way possible. Therefore, it
                isn’t
                unnecessary to open a payment channel with every individual actor you want to use.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">All of this not only means faster transactions - some
                estimates put the upper limits of lightning network capability at nearly 1 million transactions
                per
                second - it also means lower transaction costs. The fewer transactions that have to be processed
                by
                bitcoin's consensus mechanisms, the fewer fees have to be paid.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="section-heading" tabindex="0">Bitcoin's Killer Application</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">By enabling the transaction to occur through payment
                channels rather than on-chain, the lightning network offers a potential way for bitcoin to address its
                scalability problem. People have likened this to what fiat currency did for gold, arguing that the
                lightning network could be bitcoin's killer application.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The analogy works when you think about it, fiat
                currency was a way of scaling gold, just like the lightning network is a way of scaling bitcoin. In a
                sense, Fiat 'killed' gold as a currency and turned it into a value store. It remains to be
                seen if the lightning network can do this for Bitcoin.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Lightning is still handling only a tiny fraction of
                on-chain transactions. Nodes are growing along with the number of wallets that support Lightning, but
                there is a long way to go to simplify the User Experience of creating/managing channels and invoices.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Another, perhaps more significant, problem, is the
                risk of powerful hubs developing on the network. Hubs are big pools of capital
                that could facilitate a large proportion of the transactions in the network. This would risk the
                network's security, and of course, risk re-introducing centralisation to the system. </p>
